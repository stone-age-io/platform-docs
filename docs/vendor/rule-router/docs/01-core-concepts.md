# Core Concepts

## Unified Binary & Feature Selection

`rule-router` is a single binary that bundles three features behind feature flags:

| Feature | Purpose | Triggers it owns |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| `router` | NATS-to-NATS routing (the original behavior) | `nats` |
| `gateway` | Inbound HTTP→NATS and outbound NATS→HTTP | `http`, plus `nats` for outbound |
| `scheduler` | Cron-based publishing to NATS or HTTP | `schedule` |

Enable features explicitly in the config:

```yaml
features:
  router: true
  gateway: false
  scheduler: false
```

…or via environment variables (`RR_FEATURES_GATEWAY=true`, `RR_FEATURES_SCHEDULER=true`).

If no `features` block is present, `router` defaults to `true` for backward compatibility. Multiple features can run in the same process and share NATS connections, the rule engine, the metrics endpoint, and KV state — there is no benefit to running them as separate processes when they share infrastructure.

`nats-auth-manager` and `rule-cli` remain separate binaries.

---

All features of rule-router are configured using a shared rule syntax. A **rule** is a YAML object composed of a `trigger`, optional `conditions`, and an `action`.

```yaml
# A rule is defined by a trigger, optional conditions, and an action.
- trigger:
    # ... defines what starts the rule evaluation (e.g., a NATS message or an HTTP request)
  conditions:
    # ... defines the logic to determine if the action should run (e.g., field value checks)
  action:
    # ... defines what to do if the conditions pass (e.g., publish a NATS message or make an HTTP call)
```

## 1. Triggers (The "If")

A trigger defines the event that initiates a rule evaluation. Each rule has exactly one trigger type.

**NATS Trigger** (router, gateway features): Evaluates a message from a NATS subject.
```yaml
trigger:
  nats:
    subject: "sensors.temperature.>" # Supports wildcards
```

By default the router consumes via a **JetStream** pull consumer (durable, at-least-once, requires a stream covering the subject). Set `mode: core` to subscribe via **plain core NATS** instead: at-most-once, no stream or consumer needed, lowest latency — the right fit for ephemeral telemetry, monitoring taps, or subjects that have no stream. An optional `queue` joins a queue group so multiple instances load-balance messages (core mode only).
```yaml
trigger:
  nats:
    subject: "metrics.heartbeat.>"
    mode: core        # optional; "jetstream" (default) or "core"
    queue: "monitors" # optional; load-balance across core subscribers
```

Rules of thumb: pick `core` when losing a message during a restart or disconnect is acceptable; keep the JetStream default when every message must be processed. Core-mode subjects are excluded from stream validation, and a subject can safely be covered by both core-mode and JetStream rules (each rule fires exactly once, on its own transport). Core-transport triggers (`mode: core` and `reply: true`) are served by the **router** feature — enable `features.router` for them to fire.

> **Core subscriptions process one message at a time, per subject.** NATS delivers a core subscription's messages serially, so a rule's actions run to completion before the next message on that subject is read — and if they take long enough, NATS drops queued messages as a slow consumer (watch `nats_async_errors_total{kind="slow_consumer"}`). Each message's actions are capped at 30 seconds, so one bad action costs one slow message rather than the subscription. Keep core-mode rules cheap: publishes and replies, not slow outbound HTTP calls. Put anything slow on a JetStream trigger, where a worker pool processes messages concurrently and redelivery covers failures. To scale a core subject across processes, use `queue` rather than expecting in-process concurrency.

Add `reply: true` to turn the subject into a **request/reply service**: the router subscribes via core NATS (`reply` implies `mode: core`) and answers each request via a `respond` action. An optional `queue` joins a queue group so multiple instances load-balance requests.
```yaml
trigger:
  nats:
    subject: "services.geocode"
    reply: true
    queue: "geocoders"   # optional; load-balance across responders
```
See [Request/Reply & responses](#requestreply-responses) below.

**HTTP Trigger** (gateway feature): Evaluates an incoming HTTP request.
```yaml
trigger:
  http:
    path: "/webhooks/github"   # Exact or NATS-style wildcard: /webhooks/*/events, /api/>
    method: "POST"             # Optional, defaults to all methods
```

HTTP paths support the same wildcard syntax as NATS subjects, with `/` as the separator: `*` matches one segment, `>` matches one or more trailing segments and must be the final segment. Exact and wildcard rules both fire when both match. See [02 Gateway — Path matching](./02-gateway.md#path-matching) for details.

**Schedule Trigger** (scheduler feature): Fires on a cron schedule.
```yaml
trigger:
  schedule:
    cron: "0 8 * * 1-5"           # Standard 5-field cron expression
    timezone: "America/New_York"   # Optional IANA timezone, defaults to system local
```

Schedule-triggered rules have no incoming message payload. Conditions can use time variables (`{@time.*}`, `{@day.*}`, `{@date.*}`) and KV lookups (`{@kv.*}`), but not message fields or header/subject context. Schedule rules support both NATS and HTTP actions — HTTP actions include configurable retry with exponential backoff.

## 2. Conditions (The "When")

Conditions are an optional block of logic that must evaluate to `true` for the action to be executed.

### Template Syntax

**All field references must use explicit template syntax:** `{variable}`

This consistent syntax applies to both the `field` (left side) and `value` (right side) of conditions.

**Supported Variable Types:**
- Message fields: `{temperature}`, `{user.name}`
- System variables: `{@time.hour}`, `{@subject.1}`, `{@header.X-Device-ID}`
- KV lookups: `{@kv.device_status.{device_id}:status}`

**Values can be:**
- Templates (for variable comparisons): `{threshold}`, `{@kv.config:max_temp}`
- Literals: `30`, `"active"`, `true`

### Basic Condition Examples

```yaml
conditions:
  operator: and # or "or"
  items:
    # Compare message field to literal
    - field: "{temperature}"
      operator: gte
      value: 30
    
    # Check an HTTP header
    - field: "{@header.X-Device-Auth}"
      operator: "exists"
    
    # Check the time of day
    - field: "{@time.hour}"
      operator: gte
      value: 9
    
    # Check a value from a NATS KV store
    - field: "{@kv.device_status.{device_id}:status}"
      operator: "eq"
      value: "active"
```

### Variable-to-Variable Comparisons (NEW!)

The rule engine now supports comparing variables to other variables, enabling dynamic thresholds and cross-field validation:

```yaml
conditions:
  operator: and
  items:
    # Compare two message fields
    - field: "{end_timestamp}"
      operator: gt
      value: "{start_timestamp}"
    
    # Compare message field to KV value
    - field: "{temperature}"
      operator: gt
      value: "{@kv.sensor_config.{sensor_id}:max_temp}"
    
    # Compare to system variable
    - field: "{last_update_hour}"
      operator: eq
      value: "{@time.hour}"
    
    # Permission level check
    - field: "{user_level}"
      operator: gte
      value: "{@kv.permissions.{resource_id}:required_level}"
```

### Type Handling

Variables are resolved to their native types for accurate comparison:
- **Numbers remain numbers**: `{temperature}` → `25.5` (float)
- **Strings remain strings**: `{status}` → `"active"`
- **Booleans remain booleans**: `{enabled}` → `true`
- **Automatic type coercion**: When comparing different types (e.g., string `"30"` vs number `30`)

This ensures numeric comparisons work correctly:
```yaml
# These both work correctly
- field: "{count}"        # count = 42 (number)
  operator: gt
  value: "{limit}"        # limit = 50 (number)

- field: "{count}"        # count = 42 (number)
  operator: gt
  value: "40"             # String "40" coerced to number
```

### Common Use Cases

**Dynamic Thresholds:**
```yaml
# Threshold stored in KV, different per sensor
- field: "{temperature}"
  operator: gt
  value: "{@kv.sensor_config.{sensor_id}:max_temp}"
```

**Cross-Field Validation:**
```yaml
# Ensure end time is after start time
- field: "{end_timestamp}"
  operator: gt
  value: "{start_timestamp}"
```

**Range Checks:**
```yaml
# Value must be within KV-defined range
conditions:
  operator: and
  items:
    - field: "{value}"
      operator: gte
      value: "{@kv.ranges.{sensor_type}:min}"
    - field: "{value}"
      operator: lte
      value: "{@kv.ranges.{sensor_type}:max}"
```

**Access Control:**
```yaml
# User level must meet or exceed required level
- field: "{user_level}"
  operator: gte
  value: "{@kv.permissions.{resource_id}:required_level}"
```

**Rate Limiting:**
```yaml
# Current usage must be below limit
- field: "{current_requests}"
  operator: lt
  value: "{@kv.rate_limits.{user_id}:requests_per_hour}"
```

### Available Operators

See [04 System Variables — Condition Operators](./04-system-variables.md#condition-operators) for the canonical reference covering comparison, string/array, time-based, and array-iteration operators.

## 3. Actions (The "Then")

An action defines the work to be done when a rule's conditions are met.

**NATS Action**: Publishes a new message to a NATS subject.
```yaml
action:
  nats:
    subject: "alerts.high_temp.{device_id}"
    payload: |
      {
        "alert": "High temperature detected!",
        "temp": {temperature},
        "device": "{device_id}",
        "timestamp": "{@timestamp()}"
      }
```

An optional `mode` overrides the global `nats.publish.mode` config for this action: `jetstream` publishes with an awaited ack (requires a stream covering the action subject), `core` is a fire-and-forget core NATS publish (no ack, no stream needed). Omit it to inherit the global default.
```yaml
action:
  nats:
    subject: "notifications.ui.{device_id}"
    mode: core   # optional; "jetstream" or "core"; omit to inherit nats.publish.mode
    payload: '{"status": "ok"}'
```

**HTTP Action**: Makes an outbound HTTP request to an external service.
```yaml
action:
  http:
    url: "https://api.pagerduty.com/incidents"
    method: "POST"
    headers:
      Authorization: "Token ${PAGERDUTY_TOKEN}" # Env vars supported
    payload: '{"service": "app-alerts", "message": "{alert_message}"}'
    retry:
      maxAttempts: 3
      initialDelay: "1s"
      maxDelay: "30s"
```

**Respond Action**: Returns the evaluated payload to the *caller* instead of publishing onward. On an HTTP-triggered rule it is written as the HTTP response body; on a NATS trigger with `reply: true` it is sent back via `msg.Respond`. A respond is a single terminal response, so it supports `payload`/`passthrough`/`merge`/`headers` (same as other actions) plus an HTTP-only `statusCode` (defaults to 200) — but no `forEach` or `debounce`.
```yaml
action:
  respond:
    statusCode: 200            # HTTP only; ignored for NATS replies
    headers:
      Content-Type: "application/json"
    payload: |
      {
        "symbol": "{symbol}",
        "price": {@kv.prices.{symbol}:last},
        "quoteId": "{@uuid7()}"
      }
```

**HTTP Retry Configuration:**

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `maxAttempts` | int | `1` | Total attempts including the first. Defaults to 1 (no retry) — opt in explicitly per rule. Retrying POST/PATCH can double-write if a failed request actually reached the server, so the safe default is off. |
| `initialDelay` | duration string | `"1s"` | Delay before the second attempt. Format: Go duration (`"500ms"`, `"2s"`, `"1m"`). |
| `maxDelay` | duration string | `"30s"` | Cap on the backoff. Prevents runaway delays on long retry chains. |

Backoff doubles each attempt (`initialDelay`, `2×`, `4×`, …) up to `maxDelay`, and a small random jitter (≤100ms) is added each round to avoid thundering herds when multiple actions retry simultaneously. Retries are issued for any non-2xx response or transport error. The retry context honors graceful shutdown — in-flight retries are cancelled when the application terminates.

**Optional `publishResponse`**: Capture the HTTP response body and republish it to a NATS subject. On a 2xx response, the body (capped at 1 MB) is published as a NATS message — typically consumed by a router rule that performs the actual evaluation. Available wherever HTTP actions are used (scheduler cron triggers, gateway outbound NATS→HTTP, router NATS-trigger + HTTP-action rules).

```yaml
action:
  http:
    url: "https://api.example.com/devices/{device_id}/status"
    method: GET
    publishResponse:
      subject: "poll.devices.{device_id}.status"
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `subject` | string (required) | NATS subject to publish the response body to. Supports template syntax. |

**Behavior:**
- **Success-only**: the response is only published on a 2xx status. Non-2xx responses retry per `retry` config and never publish.
- **Body cap**: the body is read up to 1 MB; anything beyond is truncated.
- **Trigger-context templating**: the subject is templated against the trigger context only (cron + KV + system functions for scheduler, message + subject + KV for router). Response fields are **not** available in the subject — keeping templating consistent across the rule.
- **Best-effort publish**: a publish failure logs an error but does not fail the action (the HTTP call already succeeded; retrying it is wasteful).
- **Common pattern**: pair a scheduler poll with `publishResponse` and a router rule that subscribes to that subject — this turns "poll an API for state" into a normal event-driven flow.

### Request/Reply & responses

By default every flow is fire-and-forget: a rule receives an event and publishes/calls onward, never answering the caller. Three opt-in shapes add a **correlated response path**, built from the `respond` action and a `request` flag on the NATS action. The rule evaluation is identical — only where the result goes changes.

| Shape | Trigger | Action | Result |
|-------|---------|--------|--------|
| **HTTP synchronous response** | `http` | `respond` | Evaluated payload is returned as the HTTP response (status/headers/body) |
| **NATS responder** | `nats` + `reply: true` | `respond` | Evaluated payload is sent back via `msg.Respond` |
| **HTTP↔NATS bridge** | `http` | `nats` + `request: true` | Gateway issues `nc.Request` and returns the reply as the HTTP response |

```yaml
# NATS responder: answer requests on a service subject
- trigger:
    nats:
      subject: "services.geocode"
      reply: true
      queue: "geocoders"
  action:
    respond:
      payload: '{"lat": {@kv.geocache.{address}:lat}}'

# HTTP↔NATS bridge: expose a NATS service as an HTTP endpoint
- trigger:
    http:
      path: "/api/geocode"
      method: "POST"
  action:
    nats:
      subject: "services.geocode"
      request: true
      timeout: "3s"          # optional; defaults to 5s
```

**Rules and constraints (enforced at load time):**
- A `respond` action requires an HTTP trigger **or** a NATS trigger with `reply: true`.
- A NATS trigger with `reply: true` requires a `respond` action (a reply subject with nothing to reply with is rejected).
- `request: true` on a NATS action is honored **only on HTTP triggers** (the bridge). Using it for mid-pipeline NATS enrichment is not supported.
- When multiple rules match one request, the **first** matching rule (load order) with a respond/request action produces the single response; other rules' plain publish/HTTP actions still fire as side-effects.

The HTTP specifics (synchronous handling, status codes, `503`/`504` mapping) live in [02 Gateway — Request/reply](./02-gateway.md#requestreply-synchronous-responses-and-the-httpnats-bridge). The NATS responder is a `router`-feature capability — no separate feature flag.

### Action Payload Modes

Every action supports three payload modes:

| Mode | Field | Behavior |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Templated** (default) | `payload: "..."` | You define the complete output message. All `{variables}` are resolved. |
| **Passthrough** | `passthrough: true` | Forwards the original message unchanged. No payload field needed. |
| **Merge** | `merge: true` + `payload: "..."` | Deep-merges your payload overlay onto the original message. Original fields are preserved; overlay fields are added or overwritten. |

**Merge** is ideal for enrichment workflows where you want to add a few fields (e.g., a KV-derived tier, a UUID, a timestamp) without re-specifying every existing field:

```yaml
action:
  nats:
    subject: "enriched.orders"
    merge: true
    payload: |
      {
        "customer_tier": "{@kv.customers.{customer_id}:tier}",
        "processed_at": "{@timestamp()}",
        "trace_id": "{@uuid7()}"
      }
```

Given an input message `{"customer_id": "c1", "amount": 99.50, "items": [...]}`, the output would contain all original fields plus the three overlay fields.

**Merge semantics:**
- Overlay values overwrite base values for matching keys
- Nested objects are merged recursively (not replaced wholesale)
- Arrays in the overlay replace arrays in the base entirely
- If both `passthrough` and `merge` are set, `passthrough` wins
- In `forEach` context, the merge base is the current array element (use `{@msg.field}` to pull root fields into the overlay)

## 4. Throttle

Rules support an optional `throttle` block to limit how often something happens. It goes on an action (the common case) or on a trigger (a narrow case — see the warning below).

> **Renamed.** This block used to be called `debounce`. The old spelling still loads and behaves identically, but logs a deprecation warning at startup; setting both `throttle` and `debounce` on the same trigger or action is an error. The name changed because the default behaviour is a leading-edge rate limit, not a debounce — and `mode: trailing` now provides the actual debounce.

### Modes

| Mode | What fires | Latency | Use it for |
|------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| `leading` (default) | The **first** match in the window, immediately. The rest are dropped. | None | Alerting. You want the page now, and exactly one of them. |
| `trailing` | The **last** match in the window, when the window closes. | Up to `window` | Settling state. A dial being turned, a setpoint, a config being edited. |

```yaml
action:
  nats:
    subject: "alerts.high_temp"
    payload: '{"alert": true, "temp": {temperature}}'
    throttle:
      window: "30s"
      mode: leading         # default; may be omitted
      key: "{@subject.2}"   # one window per room
```

Neither mode subsumes the other. Leading gives you the earliest value with no delay; trailing gives you the settled value at the cost of delay. Pick by asking whether the *first* or the *final* value of a burst is the one that matters.

### Trailing mode

Trailing mode holds the evaluated action and replaces it each time the rule matches again. When the window closes, whatever is pending fires.

```yaml
- trigger:
    nats:
      subject: "thermostat.setpoint.>"
  action:
    nats:
      subject: "hvac.setpoint.applied.{@subject.2}"
      payload: '{"setpoint": {setpoint}}'
      throttle:
        window: "2s"
        mode: trailing
        key: "{@subject.2}"
```

Spin the dial from 18 → 19 → 20 → 21 within two seconds and the HVAC controller sees exactly one message, carrying 21.

Four things to know before using it:

- **The window is fixed from the first message, not reset on each one.** This is deliberately *not* the reset-on-every-keystroke debounce familiar from UI code. A continuously busy key emits once per window rather than starving forever, and emission latency is bounded by `window`.
- **Delivery becomes at-most-once.** The triggering message is ACKed when its window opens, not when the action fires — otherwise the ack would expire mid-window and JetStream would redeliver. A crash inside the window loses the pending value. On a clean shutdown (SIGTERM) pending batches are flushed rather than discarded.
- **Actions only, and not on synchronous paths.** `mode: trailing` on a trigger is a load-time error, as is combining it with `request: true`. A `respond` action takes no throttle at all. In every one of those cases something is waiting for a reply, and there is nothing to return by the time a deferred action fires.
- **A `forEach` fan-out is held as one batch.** All actions from one evaluation share a window and are replaced together, so the "last value" is the last *batch* — never a single element of it.

### Trigger throttle — read this before using it

A trigger throttle skips rule evaluation entirely. Suppressed messages are still ACKed and never redelivered. It is `leading` only.

```yaml
- trigger:
    nats:
      subject: "sensors.telemetry.>"
      throttle:
        window: "5s"
  action:
    nats:
      subject: "telemetry.sampled"
      passthrough: true
```

> **A trigger throttle samples your input stream and discards the rest — including messages that would have matched.** With a 5s window and a `temperature > 30` condition: a reading of 20 arrives at t=0, consumes the window, and matches nothing. A reading of 50 arrives at t=1 and is never evaluated. No alert fires. **If your rule has conditions, you almost certainly want an action throttle instead**, which evaluates every message and only starts a window once something actually matches.

Reach for a trigger throttle only when the rule is unconditional, or when evaluation itself is the cost you are trying to avoid — expensive KV lookups, signature verification, large `forEach` expansions on a firehose subject. On a rule with no conditions it is behaviourally identical to a leading action throttle, just cheaper.

### Throttle key

The `key` field controls what is throttled independently. It supports template syntax for grouping:

| Key | Behavior |
|-----|----------|
| *(omitted)* | Defaults to the full NATS subject or HTTP path |
| `"{@subject}"` | Same as default for NATS triggers |
| `"{@subject.2}"` | One window per subject token (e.g., per room) |
| `"{sensor_id}"` | One window per message field value |
| `"{@path.1}"` | One window per HTTP path segment |

Each rule maintains its own independent throttle state, so two rules on the same subject never interfere. Within a single rule, **messages whose `key` resolves to the same value share a window** — that is exactly the point of a non-default key. With `key: "{@subject.2}"`, everything resolving to `"room1"` shares a window while `"room2"` is tracked separately.

Choosing a key with unbounded cardinality (an order ID, a request ID) is legal but pointless: every message gets its own window and nothing is ever throttled. Entries do expire and are swept, so it leaks nothing, but it also achieves nothing.

#### Key resolution with `forEach`

An action throttle gates the action **as a unit**, and it runs *before* `forEach` expansion. Two consequences:

- A whole fan-out passes or is suppressed together. You cannot throttle individual elements.
- The key resolves against the **trigger context**, not against array elements. `key: "{sku}"` on a `forEach` action does *not* give you one window per SKU — `sku` does not exist at the message root, so it resolves empty and every message shares one window.

If you need per-element rate limiting, split the fan-out into its own subject and put a rule with a throttle on the consuming side.

### State and reloads

Leading-mode state lives in memory on the Processor. A SIGHUP reload rebuilds the Processor and therefore clears it — worth knowing if you are watching for an alert right after a config change.

Trailing-mode pending batches live in the executing layer instead, so they survive a reload and still fire. They are fully evaluated by the time they are pending, so a rule change mid-window does not alter what gets emitted.

## Environment Variables

The rule engine supports environment variable expansion for static configuration values using `${VAR_NAME}` syntax. This enables secure secret management and environment-specific configuration without hardcoding values in rule files.

### How It Works

Environment variables are expanded **at load time** (when rules are parsed from YAML files), not at runtime. This means:

- ✅ **Performance**: Zero runtime overhead - values are substituted once during startup
- ✅ **Security**: Secrets are never stored in rule files
- ✅ **Simplicity**: Standard environment variable management (Docker, K8s, systemd, etc.)
- ✅ **Validation**: Expanded values are validated along with the rest of the rule

**Important**: Environment variable expansion is completely separate from template variable substitution:
- `${ENV_VAR}` → Expanded at **load time** (static configuration)
- `{field}` or `{@system}` → Resolved at **runtime** (per-message templating)

### Syntax

```yaml
# Use ${VARIABLE_NAME} anywhere in your rules
action:
  http:
    url: "https://api.example.com"
    headers:
      Authorization: "Bearer ${API_TOKEN}"
```

### Where Can I Use Them?

Environment variables can be used in **both conditions and actions**:

#### In Actions

**NATS Actions:**
```yaml
action:
  nats:
    subject: "alerts.${ENVIRONMENT}.critical"
    payload: |
      {
        "apiKey": "${SERVICE_API_KEY}",
        "region": "${AWS_REGION}"
      }
    headers:
      X-Service-Token: "${INTERNAL_TOKEN}"
```

**HTTP Actions:**
```yaml
action:
  http:
    url: "${API_BASE_URL}/incidents"
    method: "POST"
    headers:
      Authorization: "Token ${PAGERDUTY_TOKEN}"
      X-Environment: "${DEPLOY_ENV}"
    payload: '{"service": "${SERVICE_NAME}"}'
```

#### In Conditions

Environment variables can also be used in condition values:

```yaml
conditions:
  operator: and
  items:
    # Check if status matches expected value from env
    - field: "{status}"
      operator: eq
      value: "${EXPECTED_STATUS}"
    
    # Check if environment matches
    - field: "{environment}"
      operator: in
      value: ["${PRIMARY_ENV}", "${SECONDARY_ENV}"]
```

### Missing Variables

If an environment variable is not set, the system will:

1. **Log a warning** with details about the missing variable
2. **Substitute with an empty string**
3. **Continue loading** the rule (non-fatal)

**Best Practice**: Always set required environment variables before starting the application, or the rule may not work as intended.

## Worked examples
