# KV Rule Store

Rules are standalone YAML files, decoupled from the application binaries. When KV rule storage is enabled, the server watches a NATS KV bucket and hot-reloads on any change — you never restart to deploy new routing logic.

This makes rules ideal for a **GitOps workflow**: author rules in version control, validate in CI with `rule-cli lint` and `rule-cli test`, and push to NATS KV on merge.

-----

## Overview

By default, rules are loaded from YAML files in the `rules/` directory at startup. KV rule storage is an optional alternative that **replaces** file-based loading:

| | File-based (default) | KV-based |
|---|---|---|
| **Rule source** | `rules/` directory | NATS KV bucket |
| **When rules load** | At startup (or SIGHUP reload) | Continuously via KV Watch |
| **Hot reload** | Requires SIGHUP signal | Automatic on any KV change |
| **Dynamic subjects** | Requires restart for new subjects | Consumers/cron jobs created/removed automatically |
| **Best for** | Simple deployments, local dev | GitOps, multi-team, dynamic environments |

Both modes use the exact same YAML rule format. A rule that works from a file works identically from KV.

-----

## Configuration

Enable KV rule storage in your application config:

```yaml
kv:
  enabled: true
  buckets:
    - "device_status"

  rules:
    enabled: true             # Enable KV-based rule storage
    bucket: "rules"           # KV bucket name (default: "rules")
    autoProvision: false      # Auto-create the bucket if it doesn't exist
```

When `kv.rules.enabled` is `true`, the `rules/` directory is ignored. All rules come from the KV bucket.

### When to enable `autoProvision`

The default is `false`. Auto-provisioning only fires when the bucket does not yet exist — if the bucket is already present, the flag is a no-op and the existing bucket (with whatever settings it has) is used as-is.

| Setting | Use when |
|---------|----------|
| `autoProvision: false` | Strict GitOps / IaC workflows where bucket creation must go through Terraform, NACK CRDs, or an explicit `nats kv add` step that is reviewed alongside other infra changes. |
| `autoProvision: true` | First-run convenience. The application creates the bucket with JetStream defaults (history=1, no TTL, single replica, file storage) on initial startup, and you tune it afterwards with `nats kv edit rules` (or `nats stream edit KV_rules` for the underlying stream). Safe to leave on in production — it never modifies an existing bucket. |

Most KV bucket settings (history, TTL, max bytes, replicas, storage tier) are mutable after creation, so `autoProvision: true` followed by a one-time `nats kv edit` is a perfectly valid bootstrap pattern.

This works with all features:
*   **Router**: NATS trigger rules are loaded from KV, consumers created dynamically.
*   **Gateway**: Both inbound (HTTP trigger) and outbound (NATS trigger + HTTP action) rules are loaded from KV. Inbound HTTP paths are handled via a catch-all handler that performs a fast path-existence check — unknown paths return `404` without body read or queue impact, matching file-mode behavior. See [02 Gateway — Path matching](./02-gateway.md#path-matching) for the mode comparison.
*   **Scheduler**: Schedule-triggered rules are loaded from KV. Cron jobs are rebuilt automatically when rules change — no restart or SIGHUP needed.

## Pushing Rules

Use `rule-cli kv push` to upload rule files to the KV bucket:

```bash
# Push a single file
rule-cli kv push sensors/tank.yaml --url nats://localhost:4222

# Push all YAML files in a directory (non-recursive)
rule-cli kv push sensors/ --url nats://localhost:4222

# Push with credentials
rule-cli kv push rules/ --url nats://my-server:4222 --creds /path/to/creds.json

# Preview what would be pushed without writing
rule-cli kv push sensors/ --dry-run
```

### KV Key Derivation

When pushing, the file path determines the KV key:

1. Strip the `.yaml` or `.yml` extension
2. Replace path separators (`/`, `\`) with `.`

| File Path | KV Key |
|---|---|
| `routing.yaml` | `routing` |
| `sensors/tank.yaml` | `sensors.tank` |
| `alerts/critical.yml` | `alerts.critical` |

Your directory structure maps directly to a dotted namespace in the KV store.

### Directory Push Behavior

`rule-cli kv push <dir>` pushes all `*.yaml` and `*.yml` files in the given directory but **does not recurse** into subdirectories. To push a nested structure, push each directory separately:

```bash
rule-cli kv push sensors/   --url $NATS_URL
rule-cli kv push alerts/    --url $NATS_URL
rule-cli kv push webhooks/  --url $NATS_URL
```

-----

## Separate Rules Repository

Rules don't need to live in the same repository as your deployment. A dedicated rules repo keeps routing logic independent and lets domain teams own their rules without access to infrastructure code.

```
my-rules-repo/
├── sensors/
│   ├── tank.yaml
│   └── temperature.yaml
├── alerts/
│   └── critical.yaml
├── webhooks/
│   └── github.yaml
└── README.md
```

### GitOps Workflow

A typical CI/CD pipeline for a rules repository:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy-rules.yml
name: Deploy Rules
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-go@v5
        with:
          go-version: '1.26'

      - name: Build rule-cli
        run: go build -o rule-cli ./cmd/rule-cli

      - name: Lint Rules
        run: ./rule-cli lint --rules .

      - name: Test Rules
        run: ./rule-cli test --rules .

      - name: Push to KV
        run: |
          ./rule-cli kv push sensors/  --url ${{ secrets.NATS_URL }} --creds ${{ secrets.NATS_CREDS }}
          ./rule-cli kv push alerts/   --url ${{ secrets.NATS_URL }} --creds ${{ secrets.NATS_CREDS }}
          ./rule-cli kv push webhooks/ --url ${{ secrets.NATS_URL }} --creds ${{ secrets.NATS_CREDS }}
```

## How It Works

When KV rules are enabled, the application:

1. **Connects** to the configured KV bucket (or creates it if `autoProvision: true`).
2. **Watches** all keys using the NATS KV Watch API.
3. **Initial sync**: Loads all existing rules from the bucket. The application blocks until this completes.
4. **Live updates**: On any key put/delete, the rule set is hot-reloaded:
   - New rules are parsed, validated, and pushed to the processor.
   - New NATS trigger subjects get JetStream consumers created automatically.
   - Deleted rules have their orphaned consumers and subscriptions cleaned up.

### Scheduler Behavior

For the scheduler feature, KV rule changes trigger a cron job rebuild rather than subscription changes. When a KV key containing schedule rules is updated or deleted:

1. All existing KV-sourced cron jobs are removed.
2. New cron jobs are registered from the updated rule set.
3. The scheduler continues running — no restart, no gap in execution.

Jobs that are mid-execution when a rebuild occurs are not interrupted.

### Gateway Behavior

For the gateway feature, the inbound HTTP server registers a single catch-all handler at `/` rather than per-path handlers. On every request, the handler performs an O(1) path-existence check against the processor's current rule set:

1. Path is unknown → respond `404 Not Found` immediately (no body read, no queue enqueue).
2. Path is known → read body, canonicalize headers, enqueue for worker processing.

The check reads the same atomic rule set that `ReplaceHTTPRules` updates on each KV change, so newly added paths are live as soon as the rule is loaded, and removed paths start 404ing on the next request. There is no race between rule updates and in-flight requests.

Outbound rules (NATS trigger + HTTP action) are handled by the shared `SubscriptionManager`: new trigger subjects get consumers and subscriptions created automatically; removed subjects have their subscriptions torn down when no other key still references them.

### Stream Refresh

When a new rule references a NATS subject, the application refreshes its JetStream stream list to pick up any newly created streams. If a stream doesn't exist for a subject, the rule is still loaded but the subscription is skipped with a warning — you can create the stream later and the next rule update will pick it up.

### Validation

Rules pushed to KV go through the same validation pipeline as file-based rules:
- YAML parsing
- Environment variable expansion (`${VAR_NAME}`)
- Structural validation (trigger, conditions, action)
- KV field validation
- Stream subject validation

If a rule fails validation, it is rejected and the previous rules for that key are preserved.

## Managing Rules with `nats` CLI

You can also manage rules directly with the `nats` CLI:

```bash
# Create the rules bucket
nats kv add rules

# Put a rule
nats kv put rules sensors.tank < sensors/tank.yaml

# Get a rule
nats kv get rules sensors.tank

# List all rule keys
nats kv ls rules

# Delete a rule
nats kv del rules sensors.tank

# Watch for changes (useful for debugging)
nats kv watch rules
```
